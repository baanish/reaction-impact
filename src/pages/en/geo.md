Geo is the element of the Earth.

## General Info

Geo is a very defensive element. The shields produced by [crystallize](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/crystalize) are really nice to have as they stop damage and stagger. This allows the DPS characters to work without having to dodge.
