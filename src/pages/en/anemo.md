Anemo is the element of the wind.

## General Info

Anemo is generally used as a support element. Xiao is a notable exception, as he is a main DPS character. Anemo characters usually also have some form of Crowd control. They excel at grouping enemies together, and then debuffing them via the viridescent venerer set.

### Viridescent Venerer
The viridescent set is one of the best support sets in the game. It can boost the damage of Swirled elements by 40%. This set is limited to only boosting the PECH([Pyro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/pyro), [Electro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/electro), [Cryo](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/cryo), [Hydro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/hydro)) elements which can be swirled.
