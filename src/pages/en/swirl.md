## Triggering Elements
### Anemo
Applying Anemo onto 
[Cryo](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/cryo), 
[Electro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/electro), 
[Hydro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/hydro), 
and [Pyro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/pyro) 
can trigger an swirl reaction.

## Effects
Applying Anemo onto an enemy with one of the PECH
([Cryo](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/cryo), 
[Electro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/electro), 
[Hydro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/hydro), 
and [Pyro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/pyro)) 
elements will case an AOE ring of damage of that element around the affected enemy. 
    
> **_NOTE:_**  It is possible to swirl an element on the player character as well, Jean and Kazuha are two examples who can do that.

This effect will trigger the asscoiated reactions if the enemies around the swirled character have an element on them.

> **_Example:_**  Swirling [Pyro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/pyro) near an ememy effected by [Cryo](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/cryo) will trigger an [Melt](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/melt) reaction on the enemy with cryo on it.
