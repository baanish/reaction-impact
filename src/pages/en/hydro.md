Hydro is the element of water.

## General Info
Hydro is generally used as a Support/Sub-DPS element. Hydro characters usually have hp scaling abilities. It is a part of the [Vaporize](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/vaporize) reaction, which is used by some of the top DPS characters in the game. [Frozen](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/frozen) is a very useful for crowd control but hydro benefits less from it than [Cryo](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/cryo). [Electro-charged](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/electro-charged) is a very useful reaction for Hydro characters, as it allows them to do more damage to groups of enemies.
