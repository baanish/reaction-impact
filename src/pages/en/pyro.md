Pyro is the element of fire.

## General Info
Pyro is generally used as a DPS element. It is a part of the [Vaporize](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/vaporize) reaction, which is used by some of the top DPS characters in the game. Pyro also has Bennet who is arguably the strongest character in the game, he can deal massive damage with his elemental skill and ult, buff his teammates, heal them, and is a decent energy battery. 

There is no reliable way to apply enough [Cryo](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/cryo) to the enemy to trigger [Melt](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/melt), so Pyro characters can't use the [Melt](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/melt) reaction to boost their damage. [Overloaded](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/overloaded) has lackluster damage, so it isn't used very often.
