Electro is the element of Electricity.

## General Info
Electro is generally used as a DPS/Sub-DPS element. Electro characters usually have some form of Energy Regeneration.

[Electro-Charged](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/electro-charged) is a very useful reaction for dealing damage to groups of enemies. [Superconduct](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/superconduct) massively boosts physical damage. [Overloaded](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/overloaded) is used very rarely as its damage is lackluster.

The reactions with [Dendro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/dendro) are incredibly powerful, and scale very well but I dont know much about them.
