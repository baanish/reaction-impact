Cryo is the element of ice.

## General Info
Cryo is generally used as either a DPS or reaction support element. [Frozen](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/frozen) is a very useful for crowd control, [Superconduct](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/superconduct) massively boosts physical damage. [Melt](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/melt) is used by characters like Ganyu to deal massive damage.

### Blizzard Strayer

Blizzard strayer is really useful with cryo characters as it boosts their Damage and crit rate. It is heavily reliant on the [Frozen](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/frozen) reaction, so it is best used with [Hydro](https://baanish.github.io/reaction-impact/en/hydro) teammates.
